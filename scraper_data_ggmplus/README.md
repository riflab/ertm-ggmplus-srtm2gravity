With this code, you can easily scrap all GGMPLUS[^1] data.

[^1]: GGMplus provides computerised gravity field maps at 0.002 deg (7.2 arc-seconds, ~220 m in latitude direction) resolution for all land areas of Earth within 60 
geographic latitude, and an adjoining ~10 km marine zone along the coast lines. The detail [see here](https://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/gravitymodels/GGMplus/GGMplus_readme.dat)
